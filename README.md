# PROJECT INFERENCE
  1. Learned the important functions of `JQuery` and it's implementation to make the Website more functional and dynamic
  2. Learned how to use the classes of `Bootstrap` to make the code responsive. The concept and the use of grid system became more crystal clear
  3. The most important part is that, the use of delay function e.g setTimeout() helped me a lot to render the vizualization
  4. I rely on HTML Structure `div` and Jquery for the animations and it worked well without `CANVAS`
 

# FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION
  1. Merge the entire `.js` script into a single file
  2. Addding Merge and Heap Sort
  3. Keeping one screen for vizualization with multiple sorting options
